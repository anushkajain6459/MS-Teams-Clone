### Agile Methodology 🏃
** Agile** is a chain of development in which specific set of tasks are performed iteration wise according to the priority. I divided the web App into smaller chunks and worked on each of them separately. When each feature was successfully added and tested, I created a new branch, then generated a PR and merged it in my main branch if no conflicts were found. Agile methodology taught me how to work flawlessly and in an organized manner.
